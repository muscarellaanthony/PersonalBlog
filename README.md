# PersonalBlog
This is a blog webiste that allows a user to submit a form that takes their username, title, and content of their post. After the user submits their post they are redirected to the blog page that shows the newest post as well as the previously made posts. There is also an option for the user to switch the theme back and forth from light mode to dark mods. I made this project to teach myself to recieve input, store it in local storage, and then extact the information in a new page. It was also good practice for making css elements from JavaScript and adding extra user accessibility. 

## Usage
To use this blog, follow the fields on the inital form page and submit your enrtry. Make sure to complete all 3 fields. After that your post will be formatted and printed on the blog page. In order to switch themes between light and dark, click the sun located in the top right corner of each page.
